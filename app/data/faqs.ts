    question: "How fast are transactions processed?",
    answer:
      "Most transfers settle to the recipient’s bank within seconds once we detect your Bitcoin payment. In rare cases (network congestion, banking delays, or required review for higher-value transactions), settlement may take longer. We’ll show status updates in real time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account to use Tapnob?",
    answer:
      "For small, one-time transfers you can use Tapnob without creating an account. For higher limits, transaction history, and recurring payments, we may require more information about you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is identity verification required?",
    answer:
      "Identity information is not required for low-value, casual use in supported jurisdictions. For regulatory and anti-fraud reasons, we request basic user details when transaction volume or single transfer amounts exceed local thresholds. In Nigeria, transfers above ₦250,000 (aggregate or single transaction) require additional sender information. Final limits may vary by country; we’ll prompt you when needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
    answer:
      "No hidden fees. We display the exact Bitcoin amount you send and the exact local currency the recipient will receive before you confirm.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which countries do you support?",
    answer:
      "We currently support payouts to Nigeria. Additional countries are rolling out; Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa are on our near-term roadmap. Sign up for updates to be notified when your country goes live.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really spend without selling all my Bitcoin?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Tapnob lets you convert only what you need at the time of payment. You stay in control of the rest of your Bitcoin in your own wallet.",
  },
  {
    question: "What wallets work with Tapnob?",
    answer:
      "Any standard Bitcoin wallet that can send to a BTC address or Lightning invoice. We recommend Lightning-enabled wallets for fastest settlement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the minimum / maximum I can send?",
    answer:
      "Minimums are low (often under the local equivalent of $5). Maximums depend on country rules and whether you’ve provided identity info. We’ll show applicable limits in the app before you send.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Tapnob custodial?",
    answer:
      "Tapnob receives the Bitcoin you authorize for conversion and triggers a bank payout. We’re not a savings wallet. You keep long-term holdings in your own custody.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if a payout fails?",
    answer:
      "If the receiving bank rejects the transfer, we’ll notify you and provide next steps, including retry or refund (minus irreversible network fees). Support is available 24/7.",
  },
